## Introduction

The `twisted` directory contains the source code and resources for the Twisted project. 

Twisted was found to offer a convenient solution to give unwanted clothes another life. It is a service that collects clothes and upcycle them into unique household items such as floor mats, pillows or home decor items. We then either resell them to their owners at a cheaper price or to new owners. Twistedâ€™s customers will get small rewards when giving away their unwanted clothes and be informed of how their clothes are recycled.
